miniHTTP is a library thought to quickly and easily develop minimal apis using Go. It is inspired by Express.js, so it should be a nice option for people comming from Node.js

### How it works

Here we provide a short example of how it works. All you have to do is start the server in some port, create your routes and handlers and the start the server.
