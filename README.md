# miniHTTP, easy APIs.

miniHTTP is a library thought to quickly and easily develop minimal apis using Go. It is inspired by Express.js, so it should be a nice option for people comming from Node.js

### How it works

Here we provide a short example of how it works. All you have to do is start the server in some port, create your routes and handlers and the start the server.

So far the library contains basic functionality for Json APIs, more features are constantly been added.
